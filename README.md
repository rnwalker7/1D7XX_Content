# 1D7XX_Content
Interactive content for the 1D7XX/X AFSCs (to be hosted on Digitize)

## Purpose
This repo is to be used for the creation and hosting of interactive content for the 1D7XX/X Learning Programs. Currently, outside of Skillsoft courses,
there is no interactive content, with PDFs, AFIs, and TOs filling in the gaps. As you can probably guess, this is not conducive to rentention of info
in today's learning environments (think about how much info you currently retain from click-click-click-done CBTs). The goal here is to create interactive
content that makes the training "stick" better!

## ROEs
- ALL content must be run client-side, nothing that reaches back to the main server.
  - The exception is simple key-value pairs that can be stored in "scratch space".
- Must be exportable to a React.js app.
- Place the content for your shred in your respective folder.
- **Please commit to the correct branch. By order of the project manager, the main branch is a restricted area. USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED.**
- Be creative!
